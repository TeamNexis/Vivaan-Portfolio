# Vivaan Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is a modern, responsive portfolio website for Vivaan, a Telegram Bot Developer and Digital Automation Expert. The application is built as a full-stack web application with a React frontend and Express backend, designed to showcase Vivaan's expertise in bot development and automation services.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Design requirements: Professional, modern, glitch-free across all devices, optimized for Netlify deployment.

## System Architecture

The application follows a **monorepo structure** with clear separation between client, server, and shared components:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with TypeScript and modern UI components
- **Backend**: Express.js API server with minimal endpoints
- **Shared**: Common schemas and type definitions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (configured but minimal usage)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom component library
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend bundling and development

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and interactions
- **shadcn/ui** component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom design system

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **Vite middleware integration** for development hot reloading
- **Memory storage** implementation as default (with database interface ready)
- **Minimal API surface** - primarily serves the React application

### UI/UX Design System
- **Dark theme by default** with theme switching capability
- **Responsive design** optimized for all device sizes
- **Custom color palette** with CSS variables for theming
- **Glass morphism effects** and modern visual elements
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** capabilities

### Content Structure
The portfolio includes several key sections:
- **Hero Section**: Animated introduction with call-to-action buttons
- **About Section**: Timeline of professional journey
- **Bot Showcase**: Display of developed Telegram bots
- **Services Section**: Available services and offerings
- **Community Section**: Information about the 100K+ member community
- **Contact Section**: Contact form and social links
- **Footer**: Additional links and PWA installation

## Data Flow

1. **Static Content**: All portfolio content is hardcoded in React components
2. **Theme State**: Managed via React Context with localStorage persistence
3. **Form Handling**: Contact forms use React Hook Form with validation
4. **Toast Notifications**: User feedback through toast system
5. **Responsive Navigation**: Mobile-friendly navigation with smooth scrolling

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite provides instant feedback during development
- **Type Checking**: `npm run check` validates TypeScript

- **Frontend Build**: Vite builds optimized static assets
- **Backend Bundle**: ESBuild creates single production server file
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend from `/dist/public`

### Deployment Targets
The application is designed for easy deployment on:
- **Netlify**: Static site deployment with serverless functions
- **Vercel**: Full-stack deployment with edge functions  
- **Replit**: Direct deployment in Replit environment
- **Traditional VPS**: Node.js server deployment

### Database Configuration
- **PostgreSQL**: Production database via Neon or similar service
- **Drizzle Migrations**: Database schema management
- **Environment Variables**: `DATABASE_URL` for database connection
- **Fallback Storage**: Memory storage when database unavailable
